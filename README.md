Description: 3 Demos of AJAX controls, chartist free library, and form submission with data manipulation.

    1. Demo 1 represents how I can take external libraries and integrate them successfully with WebForms pages.
    
    2. Demo 2 demonstrates that I can properly code and comment ajax calls and have them push/pull data from server side code.
    
    3. Demo 3 demonstrates that I can build form pages and collect data, have it be sent to the server and returned.
